Each line in the database file is for each homodimeric protein-prptein interaction
The columns are separated by the tab key, i.e., "\t"

The columns are (from left to right):
01    Database entry name
02    Title of the PDB
03    UniProt accession for Chain 1
04    UniProt accession for Chain 2
05    Resolution. "NOT" stands for resolution information not applicable, e.g., for NMR
06    Method of experimental structure determination
07    Number of inter-residue contacts between two chains
08    Sequence identity between the two chains
09    NCBI taxon ID and species name for Chain 1
10    NCBI taxon ID and species name for Chain 2
11    Number of residues for Chain 1
12    Number of residues for Chain 2
13    Dimers with similar sequence and structure
14    Sequence of Chain 1
15    Sequence of Chain 2
