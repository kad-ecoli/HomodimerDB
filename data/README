pdb/                                Stores pdb monomer structures in .tar.gz files

        seqs.fasta                  The seqs of all pdb structures stored in div/

        div/
                
                aa.tar.gz           archives, each of a folder which contains all
                ab.tar.gz           chain files for pdb entries with two middle
                ...                 that correspond to the archive name



all/                                Stores information for all dimers discovered,
                                    without redundancy removal. For HomodimerDB,
                                    these would be same sequence and in-contact.

       chains.txt                   Names of all chains involved in dimers.txt
       
       dimers.txt                   Names of all dimers discovered
       
       seqs_shorter.fasta           Sequences for each dimer, using the shorter
                                    chain for each sequence. This is the default
                                    for clustering.
       
       seqs_longer.fasta            Sequences for each dimer, using the longer 
                                    chain for each sequence.


cluster/                            Stores information resulting from sequence
                                    clustering on the sequences in 
                                    all/seqs_shorter.fasta 

       clusters.txt                 Lists the dimer names which are centers of
                                    sequence clusters. These dimer names are
                                    used as names of their respective clusters.

       groups.txt                   Lists the dimer names which are centers of
                                    structure clusters. Structure clusters are
                                    subsets of sequence clusters, and we call
                                    structure clusters "groups". These dimer
                                    names are used as names of their 
                                    respective groups.

       membership.tsv               Describes the membership of every dimer 
                                    (from all/dimers.txt) to a cluster (seq)
                                    and group (structure)


nonredundant/                       The intended output of HomodimerDB. The
                                    dimers described here comprehensively
                                    describe the PDB while being sequence
                                    and strucutre nonredundant. This data 
                                    would make a good training set for protein
                                    dimer structure prediction.
       
       chains.txt                   Names of all chains involved in dimers.txt

       dimers.txt                   Names of all dimers in the nonredundant
                                    and comprehensive dataset.

       seqs_shorter.fasta           Sequences for each dimer, using the shorter
                                    chain for each sequence.

       seqs_longer.fasta            Sequences for each dimer, using the longer
                                    chain for each sequence.


extra/                              Holds subsets of information in nonredundant/
                                    These are not comprehensive but maintain
                                    non-redundancy in terms of sequence and
                                    structure.

        cluster30_dimers.txt        These files list dimers that are involved
        cluster40_dimers.txt        in XX% sequence clustering resulting from
        ...                         nonredundant/seqs_shorter.fasta

        cluster30_seqs_longer.fasta    These list the sequences involved in each
        cluster40_seqs_longer.fasta    respective cluster. Here, we include the
        ...                            longer sequence of each dimer. Note the
                                       clustering was done upon the shorter seqs.

        cluster30_seqs_shorter.fasta   These list the sequences involved in each
        cluster40_seqs_shorter.fasta   respective cluster. Here, we include the
        ...                            shorter sequence of each dimer, which was
                                       the seq used for clustering.
